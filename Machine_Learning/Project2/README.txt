Kaley Findley Assignment 2

FOR PART 1:
To run my code. In the root of the ABAGAIL directory there is a bash script called runner2 that runs the Neural Network test for Part 1 of the assignment. This will create a text file with the results called NNRandOptimization. I manipulated AbaloneTest in src/opt/test directory for Part 1. Also in that directory is my data set called 3000_train.

FOR PART 2:

This all takes place in the src/opt/test directory in ABAGAIL. I created separate files for each algorithm for FourPeaks, Max K-Coloring, and Traveling Salesman. In this directory there is another bash script called runner that runs all the algorithms for each problem. This will create a separate text file for each test.

Then there is a python script that will read in each of these text files and represent the results into organized CSV files so theyâ€™re easier to graph.
