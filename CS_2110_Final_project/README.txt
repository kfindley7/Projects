CS 2110 HW9 Lonely T-Rex Run

I recreated the Google T-Rex Game so the objective of the game is pretty simple. Jump over the obstacles and try to survive as long as possible to achieve a high score. However some of the controls are slightly different. You can move left and right and also either do a stationary jump or do a SUPER JUMP left or right. Act fast and survive! You're the last T-Rex on the planet!

CONTROLS: Press the A button to jump a short distance. Use the left or right arrow buttons to move left or right respectively. Hold either the left or right arrow buttons and press the A button (jump) to perform a SUPER JUMP!

**NOTE: Button A is mapped to Z in vbam

Game is over once the T-Rex hits a cactus. Press the Start button to try again. Press the Select button at anytime during the game to go back to the title screen.
